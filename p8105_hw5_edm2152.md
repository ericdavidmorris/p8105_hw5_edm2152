```

Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time, and comment on differences between groups.

``` r
# I initially converted the id variable to a numeric variable in my tidying above. However, that wasn't working in my plot, so needed to remove that 
# and leave id as a character so I could specificy type in my ggplot to get a line for each participant 

one_df_tidy %>% 
  group_by(arm, id) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, color = arm, type = id)) + 
  geom_line()
```
