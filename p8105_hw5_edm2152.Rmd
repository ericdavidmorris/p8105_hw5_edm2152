## Problem 1 

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:

Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any other tidying that’s necessary
Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time, and comment on differences between groups.

```{r, Importing Data}

one_df = 
  tibble(participant = str_c(list.files("./data", full.names = TRUE))) %>% # Getting all file names using list.files
  mutate(long_data = map(participant, read_csv)) %>% # Using map, similar to Napoleon Dynamite Example to read in the data for each subject
  unnest()

one_df_tidy =
  one_df %>% 
  separate(participant, into = c("arm", "file"), separate = ".c")


```
