## Problem 1 

```{r, Importing and Tidying Data}

one_df = 
  tibble(participant = list.files("./data", full.names = TRUE)) %>% # Getting all file names using list.files
  mutate(long_data = map(participant, read_csv)) %>% # Using map, similar to Napoleon Dynamite Example to read in the data for each subject
  unnest()

one_df_tidy = # Creating a new data frame for the tidy version of this dataset and tidying 
  one_df %>% 
  separate(participant, into = c("arm", "id"), sep = "_") %>% 
  separate(arm, into = c("filler1", "arm"), sep = "a/") %>% 
  separate(id, into = c("id", "filler2"), sep = ".c") %>% 
  select(-starts_with("fill")) %>% 
  mutate(arm = str_replace(arm, "con", "control"),
         arm = str_replace(arm, "exp", "experimental")) %>%
  gather(key = week, value = observation, week_1:week_8) %>% 
  separate(week, into = c("filler", "week"), sep = "_") %>% 
  select(-filler) %>% 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week))
```

Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time, and comment on differences between groups.

```{r, Spaghetti Plot}

one_df_tidy %>% 
  group_by(arm, id) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, color = arm, type = id)) + 
  geom_line()

```
