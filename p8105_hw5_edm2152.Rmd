knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(rvest)
library(purrr)
```

## Problem 1 

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:

Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the list.files function will help
Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe
Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any other tidying that’s necessary
Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time, and comment on differences between groups.

```{r, Importing Data}

# Getting all file names using list.files function and iterating over file names and reading in the data using map: 

one_df = 
  tibble(participant = list.files("./data", full.names = TRUE),
         csv = str_c(participant)) %>% 
  mutate(long_data = map(csv, read_csv)) %>% 
  unnest()


```
